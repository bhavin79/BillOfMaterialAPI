# BillOfMaterialAPI

## TL;DR
Its a RESTful API developed using ExpressJS, Mongoose, and MongoDB. JWT is implemented for authorization and securying API endpoints. "bcrypt" is used for genrating hash for passwords. 
"Express-rate-limit" is used to limit the access to API per user per window of time. To overcome usual security vulnerability "helmet" middleware is used.
